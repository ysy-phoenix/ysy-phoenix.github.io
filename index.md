## About Me

I am a Master student at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Prof. [Qi Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Technology at USTC. During my studies, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) in the Systems Group, where I was mentored by Dr. Mao Yang and Prof. Yang Wang. My research interests lie in the intersection of large language models and code intelligence and model quantization.

## Research Interests
