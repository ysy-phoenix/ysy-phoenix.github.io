## About Me

I am a Master student at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Prof. [Qi Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Technology at USTC. During my studies, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) in the Systems Group, where I was mentored by [Dr. Mao Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maoyang/) and [Dr. Yang Wang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yangwang5/). My research interests lie in the intersection of large language models and code intelligence and model quantization.

## Research Interests

- Foundation Models: Pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning.
- Code Intelligence: Code-specialized LLMs for program synthesis, analysis, and autonomous code generation agents.
- Efficient Deployment: Ultra-low bit precision quantization.

## Research Internships

- Microsoft Research Asia, Sept 2023 – Jun 2024, Low bit quantization for large language models
- Zhongguancun Academy, Dec 2024 – Feb 2025, Information Engine startup project
- Microsoft Research Asia, Mar 2025 – May 2025, Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
